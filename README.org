* Installation instructions
  To clone this, [[https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick][Homesick]] is needed. When that is installed, simply issue
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    homesick clone jagot/sh
    homesick link sh
    homesick rc sh
  #+END_SRC
  The last step will install dependencies, using [[./.homesickrc][this Ruby script]]. On
  macOS, a shell script called =dircolors=, pointing to =gdircolors=
  (of coreutils) will be created, and [[http://getantibody.github.io][Antibody]]. On [[https://www.archlinux.org][Arch Linux]] (where
  [[https://github.com/rmarquis/pacaur][pacaur]] has hopefully been installed beforehand), only Antibody is
  installed.
